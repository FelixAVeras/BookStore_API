## Instructions to Run the .NET 8 Web API Project

These instructions assume you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

* **.NET 8 SDK:** Download and install the .NET 8 Software Development Kit from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Text Editor:** While not strictly required, using an IDE like Visual Studio 2022 (or later) or Visual Studio Code with the C# extension will greatly enhance your development experience.

**Steps to Run the Project:**

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    * Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
    * Use the `cd` command to navigate to the root directory of your .NET 8 Web API project (the folder containing the `.csproj` file).

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project/directory
    ```

2.  **Restore NuGet Packages:**
    * .NET projects rely on NuGet packages for dependencies. Ensure all necessary packages (like `System.Net.Http.Json`) are downloaded and installed. You can do this using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

    * If you are using Visual Studio, it typically restores packages automatically when you open the project. You can also manually trigger it by right-clicking on the solution or project in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Restore NuGet Packages".

3.  **Build the Project:**
    * Compile your project's code into an executable application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

    * In Visual Studio, you can build the project by going to "Build" > "Build Solution" (or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B`).

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * Execute the built Web API using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    * If you are using Visual Studio, you can run the application by pressing `F5` or clicking the "IIS Express" or your project's name button in the toolbar.

5.  **Access the API Endpoints:**
    * Once the application is running, it will typically output the URL(s) where your API is hosted (usually on `localhost` with a specific port, e.g., `https://localhost:7xxx`).
    * You can then use tools like:
        * **Web Browsers:** For `GET` requests to simple endpoints.
        * **Swagger UI:** If your project is configured with Swashbuckle (which is common for new Web API projects), you can access the Swagger UI at a URL like `https://localhost:yourport/swagger/index.html` to explore and test your API endpoints.
        * **Postman or Insomnia:** These are popular API testing tools that allow you to send various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with custom headers and request bodies.

**Important Notes:**

* **Configuration:** Ensure your `appsettings.json` file (or other configuration sources) is correctly set up, especially the `ExternalApiSettings:BaseUrl` if you followed the comprehensive example.
* **Error Handling:** If you encounter errors during startup or when accessing endpoints, check the console output or Visual Studio's output window for error messages.
* **External API Availability:** Make sure the external API you are trying to consume (`https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/Books` or your specific author API URL) is running and accessible. Network connectivity issues or problems with the external API will prevent your application from working correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run your .NET 8 Web API project and interact with its endpoints. Remember to replace any placeholder URLs with the actual URLs of the external APIs you are using.
